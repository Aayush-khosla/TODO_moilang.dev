# TODO_moilang.dev
## I wrote the code in CoCo, initially attempting to use the 'map' method for the delete function.
## Encountered two challenges:
### Iteration problem: Difficulty displaying todo elements due to iteration issues.
### Unique identifier issue: Generating unique identifiers for mapping proved to be tricky.
### Opted for an alternative solution using the array.
### Implemented the delete function using array methods such as 'merge' and 'slice' to address the challenges effectively.
